# Linear-Regression
Here , I have performed Basic Linear Regression using Sklearn package in Python and the Seaborn package for the data visualization, using the dataset from an e-commerce company 
I have predicted if the company should focus on the development of their application or website, by estimating the co-efficient which would yield more profit for the company.
